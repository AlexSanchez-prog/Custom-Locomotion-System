# Custom-Locomotion-System
Custom Locomotion System (Lightweight + Parkour Extension)
This project is an optimized and extended version of free locomotion systems available on the Epic Games Store. It starts with the Echo Project as a base and has been significantly improved to be lighter, more flexible, and faster, while maintaining high-quality visuals and responsive gameplay.
Main Features:

    🔁 Optimized locomotion system: Based on the Echo Project, with unnecessary elements removed and overall performance enhanced.

    🏃‍♂️ Additional animations: Integrated animations from the Locomotion System V4, including newly added states like running, sprinting, and jumping, which were manually implemented.

    🧗 Parkour mode: Custom implementation using free parkour animations, adding a new layer of movement and fluidity.

    🔧 Greater flexibility and modularity to adapt the system to various types of projects.

This system is ideal for developers looking for a solid Unreal Engine locomotion base with the freedom to expand and customize it as needed.
